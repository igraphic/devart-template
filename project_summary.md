## Description

Happy Shapes is a new artistic concept: art that is randomly generated by code. It's a simple web application that generates fun, whimsical illustrations using basic shapes and optional parameters that can be specified by the user. 

- Current Shape Options 
- Circle
- Square
- Rectangle
- Triangle 
- Hexagon
- Octagon

Parameters Options
- size
- color
- number
- opacity
- rotation 

The user can control these parameters by using *Happy Shapes* options, and now with the "Surprise me!" button, **Happy Shapes** will work based on a set of randomly selected shapes and parameters — which is a lot of fun! 

Users also have the option to specify the canvas size of their Happy Shapes creation, and are able to download both raster and vector versions of their work. Happy Shapes can be used in both desktop and mobile browsers. 

The future of Happy Shapes
- Randomly generated animated images (GIF), and Viedos
- Integration with Google Maps, the map will be in the background, and **Happy Shapes** will display photos from the current - - location using the **Happy Shapes** way.
- View photo albums from Google+
- Sharing options
- More shape options
- More color scheme options
