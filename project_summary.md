## Description

The idea behind Happy Shapes is to implement a new artistic concept: art authored by computer. 

Input is given to the software without specific values. Happy Shapes adds more possibilities, and fewer rules. The computer then manipulates this input with values that assigned **by the computer**, to generate unexpected art.

**Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results** _Albert Einstein_

With Happy Shapes, repeating the same step every time will lead to different results!

**We try not to control everything - Why?**
Let’s assume that there are no clouds, and we have to make our own clouds,  and put them in the sky, so we can make rain, and get water to survive. **Will that clouds be more beautiful than what we have now? Will everyone on earth will enjoy looking at it?** It’s scary to imagine the difference between the clouds in the rich countries and clouds in the poor countries.

The source of the human creativity is in nature. **We have no control of it!** Nature’s true beauty is untouched by human control.

## Idea History

About 8 months ago I watched a TED video, _Joshua Foer: Feats of memory anyone can do._ in that video, Joshua talked about memorization techniques. The most successful technique to remember lists of things or speech, is to imagine a really weird story and link it to the things that you want to remember.

When I started Happy Shapes, my goal was to create a computer program to automatically fabricate these “weird” stories. I imagined software that can take a list of words or numbers and  write a memorable, animated scenario, based on predefined objects.

Since then, Happy Shapes took on its own form and has in part, been shaped by the parameters of this contest. The Happy Shapes idea evolved into a new one: Computer Generated Art.

Another idea has evolved since the inception of Happy Shapes. Even though the idea of Happy Shapes is focussed on random and uncontrolled creation, it can also be partially guided by its users. 

As implementation of that idea, Happy Shapes is a simple web application that generates art using basic shapes and optional parameters that can be specified by the user. 

- Current Shape Options 
- Circle
- Square
- Rectangle
- Triangle 
- Hexagon
- Octagon

Parameters Options
- size
- color
- number
- opacity
- rotation 

The user can control these parameters by using *Happy Shapes* options, and now with the "Surprise me!" button, **Happy Shapes** will work based on a set of randomly selected shapes and parameters — which is a lot of fun! 

Users also have the option to specify the canvas size of their Happy Shapes creation, and are able to download both raster and vector versions of their work. Happy Shapes can be used in both desktop and mobile browsers. 

The future of Happy Shapes
- Randomly generated animated images (GIF), and Viedos
- Integration with Google Maps, the map will be in the background, and **Happy Shapes** will display photos from the current - - location using the **Happy Shapes** way.
- View photo albums from Google+
- Sharing options
- More shape options
- More color scheme options
