**Happy Shapes** (_will surprise you!_)
## Authors

## Description
It's a simple web application to generate beautiful backgrounds using basic shapes. The number of shapes used are specified by the user, and the shapes parameters are specified randomly by **Happy Shapes**. 

The current shapes used are 
- Circle
- Square
- Rectangle
- Triangle 
- Hexagon
- Octagon

The parameters are:
size, color, position, rotation .... 

However the user can control all these parameters using **Happy Shapes** options, and now with the "Surprise me!" button **Happy Shapes** will work based on a set of options selected randomly, which is a lot of fun ;)
