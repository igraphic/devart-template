A new button has been added "Surprise me!" button. It's a unique and beautiful art with one click!

## Users of Happy Shapes inspire me :)

Based on the usage statistics for the prototype, I noticed that most of **Happy Shapes** users don't use the options dialogue, however most of the fun gets through it, which clarified that **Happy Shapes** needs a new design, to be more easier for the users to access the options. Also it's inspired me to create the "Surprise me!" button.

When the user clicks on that button, **Happy Shapes** will work based on a set of options selected randomly, these options will be remain selected so the user can view or modify them
